-- Make Amazon Login Functions sneakier by using random ports and different user agents
-- Make initial scrape for htmlLinks to put into currently tracking synchronous (and possibly delayed) so it doesn't cause captchas.







-- Make amazonlogin function try to get htmlLink multiple times if it receives a timeout (only receiving timeout due to captchas)
-- Include catch block in all async function
-- Figure out how certain modules (e.g. puppeteer) work in heroku
-- Find all sensitive information and convert to config variables BEFORE pushing to heroku 
-- Clean up code before uploading!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
-- Push to Heroku!



-- Make page look good
-- Make currently tracking area look good




Possible:
-- Forward Emails to amazonpricetrackerapp@gmail.com to my email
	- Set up nodemailer to send email to me when an error occurs?
