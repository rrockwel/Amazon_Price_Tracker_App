-- Set up MongoDB connection through Mlab so it actually connects
	-- right now it is starting to scrape on nothing and therefore throwing a timeout error when waiting 
		for a selector



-- Make amazonlogin function try to get htmlLink multiple times if it receives a timeout (only receiving timeout due to captchas)
-- Include catch block in all async function
-- Figure out how certain modules (e.g. puppeteer) work in heroku



-- Make page look good
-- Make currently tracking area look good
--



Possible:
-- Forward Emails to amazonpricetrackerapp@gmail.com to my email
	- Set up nodemailer to send email to me when an error occurs?
